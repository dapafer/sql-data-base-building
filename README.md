# **BLOCKBUSTER project.**

![portada](https://github.com/dapafer/sql-data-base-building/blob/main/images/blockbuster_ruins.png)

This project is an implementation of a database for a movie rental store called "Blockbuster". It uses SQL language to define the database structure and perform queries on it.

## DATA ANALYSIS AND TRANSFORMATION.
---
One important aspect of the Blockbuster project is the analysis and transformation of data. This involves examining the available data and applying transformations to make it more useful and meaningful for various tasks, such as generating reports or making business decisions.

## STEPS TAKEN.
---
The following steps were taken in the project:

1. Created a database named "blockbuster" using MySQL.
2. Defined the necessary tables for the store management system:
    - "actors" to store information about movie actors.
    - "films" to store information about the available movies in the store.
    - "actors_films" to establish the relationship between actors and movies.
    - "customers" to store information about the store's customers.
    - "stores" to store information about Blockbuster's physical stores.
    - "inventories" to store information about movie copies available in each store.
    - "staff" to store information about the store's personnel.
    - "rentals" to store information about movie rentals made by customers.
3. Created the relationships between the tables using primary keys and foreign keys.
4. Generated sample data for the "actors", "films", "customers", and "stores" tables.
5. Performed example queries involving multiple tables and multiple parameters using clauses such as "JOIN", "GROUP BY", and "LIMIT".
