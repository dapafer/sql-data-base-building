# **BLOCKBUSTER project.**

![portada](https://github.com/dapafer/sql-data-base-building/blob/main/images/blockbuster_ruins.png)

This project is an implementation of a database for a movie rental store called "Blockbuster". It uses SQL language to define the database structure and perform queries on it.

Steps Taken
The following steps were taken in the project:

Created a database named "blockbuster" using MySQL.
Defined the necessary tables for the store management system:
"actors" to store information about movie actors.
"films" to store information about the available movies in the store.
"actors_films" to establish the relationship between actors and movies.
"customers" to store information about the store's customers.
"stores" to store information about Blockbuster's physical stores.
"inventories" to store information about movie copies available in each store.
"staff" to store information about the store's personnel.
"rentals" to store information about movie rentals made by customers.
Created the relationships between the tables using primary keys and foreign keys.
Generated sample data for the "actors", "films", "customers", and "stores" tables.
Performed example queries involving multiple tables and multiple parameters using clauses such as "JOIN", "GROUP BY", and "LIMIT".
Data Analysis and Transformation
One important aspect of the Blockbuster project is the analysis and transformation of data. This involves examining the available data and applying transformations to make it more useful and meaningful for various tasks, such as generating reports or making business decisions.

For example, the data analysis process may involve:

Reviewing the "films" table to analyze movie attributes like release year, rating, and length.
Applying filters and aggregations to identify trends in movie popularity or average ratings.
Joining the "rentals" table with the "customers" and "films" tables to analyze rental patterns for specific customers or movies.
Using the "GROUP BY" clause to group data by certain attributes, such as customer ID or movie category, to perform aggregate calculations or generate statistics.
Transforming data formats, such as converting date and time columns into a more readable format or calculating derived columns based on existing data.
By conducting data analysis and applying transformations, valuable insights can be gained from the Blockbuster database, enabling informed decision-making and improving the overall management of the movie rental store.

Feel free to explore the provided queries and adapt them to your specific data analysis needs.
